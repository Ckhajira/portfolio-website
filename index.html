                    I am currently a student at Moringa School, currently learning HTML and CSS. I decided to take
                    programming because I strongly believe that software development is the future and is the key to
                    solving problems in the society. In the near future, I would like to work in a startup or a tech
                    company. There after, I would like to start my own company that would be able to solve world
                    problems and come up with impactful solutions.<br>
